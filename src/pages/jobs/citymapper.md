October 2016 - March 2018

Citymapper is home to some of Londons greatest software engineers. Working with such a great team I was able to get a great understanding of the challenges of coordinating larger scale software development, as well as pick up a gret deal of varied knowledge along the way. 

I led the client side development on the standalone driver apps for Smart Ride and SmartBus, as well as working on the Citymapper consumer app. 

**Citymapper** - Citymappers consumer app provides the ultimate in mobile app challenges. Realtime data, battery consumption, offline/inconsistent network, user location and activity recognition. Then there's the UX challenge of conveying this data to the user. My favourite contributions would be the 3D walk/cycle map mode and the cards base home screen rework. 

**Smart Ride** - Smart Ride proved to be my most involved work at Citymapper. The app was to dynamically instruct drivers to navigate to, pick up and drop off named passengers at locations around Central London. Real world drivers and real world paying passengers meant real world consequences. Deploying an internal app like this showed me a different approach to mobile app production, understanding a drivers first days were crucial: keeping distribution, onboarding and training as minimal and seamless as possible. 

**SmartBus** - Before Smart Ride there was SmartBus. A night bus route in East London. Onboard tech consisted of two screens displaying information to passengers as well as a tablet for the driver. The Android tablet app ran in kiosk mode and needed to be 100% stable, relaying live tracking information to Citymapper HQ as well as a messaging system to intract with the driver.
