[Floom](http://www.floom.com) + [FloomX](http://www.floomx.com)

Floom is a VC-backed start-up on a mission to become the first vertically integrated florist software company. We believe flowers are the most universally accepted and loved gift, but seasonality and environmental impact have been too-long ignored. Since launching in Feb'16 we’ve been voted one of the top UK 100 startups two years in a row, created long-lasting relationships with florists across all of the UK and New York, whilst taken orders from loyal customers in 114 different countries.

Today we give florists the tools to create and deliver beautifully crafted bouquets to our online communities. They’re hand-made and hand-delivered with the Floom seal of approval. Florists receive a backend management tool, and customers receive more options, in more areas, by vetted florists, with the ultimate convenience of a seamless check-out and what everyone really wants - confirmation of safe receipt in their loved one’s hands.

In the next 12 months, our online offering will grow as we launch in 5 new cities across the UK and US, and introduce the very first vertically integrated florists SaaS. From inventory management, to a wholesale shop, and even website builders and POS systems. We will offer florists everything they need, ultimately allowing customers to get exactly what they ordered in the picture, on the very same day.
