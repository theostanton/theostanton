After starting off as an Android developer I was promoted to lead the development team. Managing the iOS, Android, Web, Backend, Analytics and Internal Website development. My priority was to introduce a structured work methodology into the team, so as the team could double in size, increase the technological complexity, the work efficiency and be brought into its next generation. 

**Dojo** - Dojo is a lifestyle app for helping millenials find stuff do to in their cities. Currently based in London and Paris it has 750k downloads on Android and iOS. 

**Management** - Introduced daily stand-ups, fortnightly retrospectives, fortnightly one-to-ones, knowledge sharing + pairing, application championing, git discipline, coding standards, microservice paradigms, feature roadmap paradigms, increased test coverage, structuring team-member onboarding and a glorious road map. The team became solid, excelling both technically and culturally. 

**Culture** - Culture is paramount. For my two years at Dojo I looked forward to each and every day, not once glancing at the clock. It was essential that this transpired to the rest of the development team. Transparency and candour are important to me, leaving nothing unsaid. Everybody contributes, everbody's opinion is valued and so everybody knows they are performing at their utmost, learning along the way. 

**Design** - When using any app is it possible to decipher the quality of communication between the tech and design team. Leading the tech and design teams I made sure that communication was seamless, enabling qualities from both realms to shine through. This communication is to come from the team members too, in developer roles I am sure to communicate clearly to the design team so as they are always aware of what is possible. 

**Analytics** - On becoming Head of Product a major feature I designed and pushed was an improved analytics system. Creating an in-house analytics data warehouse that fed live recommendations and suggestions to users, as well as bringing the best possibly stats to the content team, design team and business owners. I hired a specialist backend developer and a skilled data scientist specifically for the purpose. The project was complex and involved each member of the development team. The success of the project came down to smart design and architecture, consulting the relevant team members, concise documentation and careful structuring and planning of the teams workloads and dependencies. Unfortunately I finished at Dojo before it came to production, I took away a great deal of knowledge along the journey. 

**Google + Apple** - Meetings with the Play Store team at Google and the App Store team at Apple were common. Conferences at both the Google and Apple campuses to keep on top of what the platforms have to offer.
