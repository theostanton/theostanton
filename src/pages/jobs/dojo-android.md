Since day 1 I have been the sole Android developer at Dojo. It can be found here. Boasting a rating of 4.5, top five best apps of 2015 according to Google Play Store and featured countless times. It uses Androids latest technologies to remain smooth and sleak. Feature parity between iOS and Android was maintained whilst implementing some Android specific quirks to keep it feeling like an Android app. 

**Dojo** - Dojo is a lifestyle app for helping millenials find stuff do to in their cities. Currently based in London and Paris it has 750k downloads on Android and iOS. 

**RxJava** - RxJava introduces functional reactive programming to Android. Means I never have to mutter the words A-Sync-Task ever again. 

**Kotlin** - After introducing Kotlin to the Android source code last Autumn. Is a beautiful language that removes some of Javas nuances and introduces some modern language features. Coding in Java isn't an issue, I just had the privilege at Dojo of being able to implement an interoperable language into the source and too advantage of that. 

**MVP** - MVP architecture throughout the app using the Mosby library ensures the codebase is maintainable, clean and testable. 

**Material design** - Kept in close talks with the Play Store team to make sure the app was satisfying their requests and working closely with the CTO and UI/UX team, we made sure the app followed material design guidelines. Helping the user feel accustomed to the app the moment they start using it. Never settling until we hit 60 fps.
